# Portfolio

I have fourteen years of experience in technical documentation while donning many hats as Information Architect, Principal Writer, API/SDK writer, and Content Strategist.

My current responsibilities at Genpact include leading a team of writers in India to develop documentation for the Cora Platform products, which include SaaS-based software, machine learning-based analytical applications, and Pharmacovigilance product. In addition, I am responsible for the growth and development of the Indian team. The products I worked for before joining Genpact included software, cloud computing, telecommunications, document management, healthcare, games and media, energy, and business intelligence.

I am committed to being a thought leader, and I have led several documentation projects that have positively impacted customer experience, cost, and timeliness. Having worked in both Agile and waterfall models, I am interested in creating business practices and documentation processes that create relevant, searchable, and usable content.
